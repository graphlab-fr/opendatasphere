Several methods have been used to select entities with different effects. The objective is that you can access information in different ways in a navigation process in symbiosis with that of your web browser.

## Methods

The following actions allow you to select an entity :

- Click on a node in the *Network* section
- Click on a map in the *Cards* section.
- Click on one of the connections at the bottom of the description pane
- Click on a result proposal from the search bar
- (Re)load the web page with an entity identifier written at the end of the page address such as `https://otletosphere.net/<id>`
- Move back or forward in navigation: the previous or next entity is selected

!!! tip "Share an entite"
	You can share the address of the page at any time: Internet users who follow the link will immediately see the description of the entity.

## Effects

As soon as an entity is selected, the following effects apply immediately:

- Opening and updating of the description pane with the metadata of the selected entity
- Its node and its direct network cannot become [translucent](./network-navigation.md#transparency)
- Inscription of the entity identifier at the end of the page address
- Adding the entity to the browsing history
- Modification of the page name according to the entity label

To deselect a node, you must click on the white area of the *Network*.
