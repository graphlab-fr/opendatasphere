Sorting of entities acts in both the *Network* and *Records* sections. The sort commands are cumulative.

## Orders

The location of the sort commands depends on the size of your screen.

- In the header, if your screen is large enough
- Otherwise in a pane that can be opened by clicking on the funnel button at the top left of the *Network*.

Each sort command has the name and color of the group on which it acts. Clicking on the command will have the binary effect of checking or unchecking the box it integrates.

- Checked box: the group is visible
- Unchecked: the group is invisible.

## Refresh views

Both views (*Network* and *Sheets*) are updated immediately after each order. Thus the nodes and cards linked to the entities become visible or invisible and the view interface is reset.

### Network

The zoom scale is adapted to the number of entities remaining visible. Thus, the view is systematically refocused on the nodes that remain visible.

### Cards

Alphabetical navigation is updated according to the remaining maps.
