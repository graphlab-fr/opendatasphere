The following tutorial will allow you to navigate efficiently within the *Network* of the Otletosphere.

## Navigation axes

Navigation takes place on three axes:

1. up <=> down, **vertical**
2. left <=> right, **horizontal**
3. far <=> near

For the first two axes, simply hold the left mouse click on the white space of the *Network* while moving it. By moving the mouse to the left you will discover the area on the right. The same applies to the vertical axis.

The third axis can be activated with the mouse wheel as well as with the zoom (+) and dezoom (-) buttons displayed at the bottom left of the *Network*. You are limited on this axis.

!!! tip "Are you lost?"
	The eponymous button at the bottom left of the *Network* allows you to reset the view: you return to the minimum zoom scale and to the center of the visualization.

## Elements and interactions

The *Network* visualization is composed of two types of elements: nodes and links. All nodes have links converging to the central *Paul Otlet* node.

### Node selection

Clicking a node allows you to select the related entity with the [effects this has](./entities-selection.md#effects), including opening the description pane.

### Move the nodes

You can move a node by holding the left mouse click on it while moving it. The node will follow the mouse pointer, dragging its attached links and nodes to their ends. This way you can interact with the *Network* to improve your reading experience.

### Transparency

When you hover over a node, the other nodes and their links become translucent. Exceptionally, this does not affect the direct network of nodes and links of the [selected entity](./entities-selection.md). This effect applies to any node that your mouse pointer hovers over.

## From the description panel

The [description panel](./interface-elements.md#description-panel) also allows you to move around the *Network* using the [built-in tools](./entities-selection.md).
