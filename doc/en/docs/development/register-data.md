## Data model

You will find in the [directory tree](./architecture-source-code/#file-tree-structure) Otletosphere the two JSON example files: `entite.json` and `lien.json`. To bring your own content you need to replace the values in these files according to the recommendations presented on this page.

### Data format

The data integrity constraint is strong. **It is necessary to link the different objects by their identifiers**, taking care during data entry to respect the typing and relational logic at the heart of the software.

!!! bug "Empty value, null value"
    Make sure that any values not filled in are typed as "null" in your JSON files. Otherwise fields may appear empty.

#### Entities

This involves registering all the entities that will be integrated into the *Network* and *Sheets* views of the site.

Below is a sample `entite.json` file and its data table describing the typing of the different values.

=== "JSON File"
    ```json
    [
        {
            "label": "Paul Otlet",
            "id": 1,
            "relation_otlet": "otlet",
            "prenom": "Paul",
            "nom": "Otlet",
            "titre": "Fondateur du Mundaneum",
            "genre": "Homme",
            "annee_naissance": 1868,
            "annee_mort": 1944,
            "pays": "Belgique",
            "pays_en": "Belgium",
            "domaine": "Bibliographie",
            "domaine_en": "Bibliography",
            "description": "Paul Otlet est la tête pensante du Mundaneum…",
            "description_en": "Paul Otlet is the mind behind the Mundaneum…",
            "photo": "OtletPaul.png",
            "lien_wikipedia": "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Otlet"
        }
    ]
    ```

#### Links

This defines the relationships between entities created according to the above model as they will appear in the *Network* view and the *Connections* portion of the [View Pane]().

Below is a sample `lien.json' file and its data table.

=== "JSON file"
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "from": 1,
            "to" : 2,
            "label" : ""
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "from": 1,
            "to" : 3,
            "label" : "Il travaillent ensemble <b>depuis 10 ans<b>"
        }
    ]
    ```

=== "Data table"
    | Key   | Value                              | Comment                                           |
    | ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | id    | unique integer greater than 0  | identifiant unique lien                          |
    | from  | unique integer greater than 0  | identifiant unique entité                        |
    | to    | unique integer greater than 0  | identifiant unique entité                        |
    | label | HTML                                | description avec des balises `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>` |

## Data injection

To customize the data injection (their integration in the software via JSON files), you have to modify the `/dist/scripts/fetch.js` file. It [can be modified in different ways depending on the approach](../modify-source-code/dev-tools.md) you have chosen to modify the source code.

`#!js network.data.nodes.add` and `#!js network.data.edges.add` are the two functions for injecting data as nodes and links respectively. More information can be found in [this example of VisJs documentation](https://github.com/visjs/vis-network#example). These two functions are given as parameters an array formed with the [`#!js Array.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function (see code below). It allows to transform the JSON file data into an object intended for the software, with among others values for the [translation](../modify-source-code/modify-translation.md#translate-data), but also for the display in the [visualization](../usage/interface-elements.md#network).

```javascript
network.data.nodes.add(
    entites.map(function(entite) {
        var entiteObj = {
            // entite metas
            id: entite.id,
            label: entite.label,
            title: entite.titre,
            title_fr: entite.titre,
            title_en: entite.titre_en,
            image: '/otletosphere/assets/photos/' + entite.photo,

            // node style
            size : 30,
            margin: 20,
            font: {
                face: 'Open Sans'
                ...
            }
        };

        return entiteObj;
    })
);
```

## Input data

In order to complete, possibly in a collaborative way, your database with the numerous metadata, while respecting the integrity constraints and with the possibility of exporting easily in JSON, we advise you to use a spreadsheet type software.

Here's a *workflow* proposal.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Entites
        entite_label
        entite_id
        relation
        prenom
        nom
        titre
        genre
        annee_naissance
        annee_mort
        pays
        pays_en
        domaine
        domaine_en
        entite_description
        entite_description_en
        photo
        lien_wikipedia
    end

    subgraph Liens
        lien_id
        from
        to
        label
    end

    subgraph Pays
        pays_label_fr --> pays
        pays_label_en --> pays_en
    end
    
    subgraph Relations
        relation_label --> relation
    end
    
    id --> from
    id --> to
```

### Tools

Here are some free, collaborative tools that are easy to use and allow you to set up an adequate input environment as presented above.

#### Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a hybrid tool between spreadsheet and database and will best help you ensure the relationship between your entity objects and links, while managing the numerous metadata that you can easily standardize.

Once the different tables are completed, you can [link their contents](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042311734) in order to facilitate the entry, but also to ensure the relationship between the identifiers.

#### Google Sheet

The [Google Sheet](https://www.google.fr/intl/fr/sheets/about/) tool provided in Google Drive allows you to have an online spreadsheet and export to JSON using the *Export Sheet Data* extension.

??? tips "Exporter en JSON avec *Export Sheet Data*"
    Install the Google Sheet extension from the *Add-ons* tab, *Download Add-ons* button.
    In the same tab is now displayed the tool: once on your *Entities* or *Links* sheet, click on *Open Sidebar* and enter the following configuration (settings not mentioned below are on *off*, unchecked) :
    ```
    Export Format : JSON
    Export Sheet(s) : Current Sheet only
    Include first column : yes
    Export contents as array : yes
    ```
    The buttons at the bottom of the *Sidebar* allow you to complete the operation. All you have to do is to integrate the files in the `/data` directory of the [software tree](./architecture-source-code/#file-tree-structure).

Do not hesitate to use the [data validation] tool (https://support.google.com/docs/answer/186103?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=fr) in conjunction with other sheets such as *Countries*, *Relations* etc. in order to standardize data completion as much as possible and avoid errors. You can also use the [integrated translation function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093331?hl=fr) in Google Sheet for your multilingual versions or the [SEARCH function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093318) to ensure the correspondence between your labels and unique identifiers.
