The Otletosphere and its software offer a multilingual dimension, currently in French and English.

Just as it is fluid to change entities, it is fluid to change the language of their description. A simple click on the language change buttons in the [header](../usage/interface-elements.md#header) and the entire contents of the [description panel](../usage/interface-elements.md#description-panel) are translated into the desired language, according to the [translation data entered in the database](../development/register-data.md).
